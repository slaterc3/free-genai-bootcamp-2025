### Semantic Structure Analysis  

This sentence is a compound imperative made up of two commands. Let’s break down the structure:

1. **First Command: "Please leave your passport in the window"**  
   - **Imperative marker:** The sentence starts with "請" (please), which softens the command.  
   - **Action:** "leave" is represented by the verb "放" (to put/leave).  
   - **Object:** "your passport" is the item being moved.  
   - **Location:** "in the window" indicates where the passport should be placed, introduced by the preposition "在".

2. **Second Command: "and proceed to the waiting line"**  
   - **Connector:** "然後" is used to link the two actions in a sequence.  
   - **Action:** "proceed" is expressed by "前往", indicating movement toward a destination.  
   - **Destination:** "the waiting line" tells where to go.

In Mandarin, the order in which these elements appear is important. Notice that in commands the structure generally follows: **[請] + [Subject/Object marker if needed] + [Verb] + [Location]**. Also, note that connecting words like "然後" help to show the sequence of instructions.

### Teacher Guidance  

#### Reflective Questions for the Student:

1. **Identifying Key Verbs:**  
   - How can you express the command “leave” in Mandarin without confusing it with “depart”?  
   - Which verb from the vocabulary table suits the meaning of “leave your passport” best?

2. **Using Connectors:**  
   - What word can you use to clearly indicate the sequence between the two commands (placing the passport and proceeding to the waiting line)?

3. **Specifying Locations:**  
   - How do you express “in the window” using the preposition “在” along with the noun for window?
   - For the second command, what structure might you use to express “to the waiting line”?

4. **Forming a Polite Imperative:**  
   - Why is it important to begin the sentence with 請?
   - Can you think of any additional structures or words (such as a marker for the object) that might help make your sentence clear?
